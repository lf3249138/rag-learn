# Large Model Application Development Practice: RAG Technology Full-Stack Guide


[中文](/) | English

This project is a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology full-stack tutorial for large model application developers. It aims to help developers master RAG application development skills based on large language models through systematic learning paths and hands-on practice projects, building production-grade intelligent Q&A and knowledge retrieval systems.

**Main content includes:**

1. **RAG Technology Fundamentals**: In-depth introduction to RAG core concepts, technical principles, and application scenarios
2. **Complete Data Processing Pipeline**: From data loading, cleaning to text chunking - the complete data preparation process
3. **Index Construction and Optimization**: Vector embedding, multimodal embedding, vector database construction and index optimization techniques
4. **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Hybrid retrieval, query construction, Text2SQL and other advanced retrieval technologies
5. **Generation Integration and Evaluation**: Formatted generation, system evaluation and optimization methods
6. **Project Practice**: Complete RAG application development practice from basic to advanced

## Project Significance

With the rapid development of large language models, RAG technology has become the core technology for building intelligent Q&A systems and knowledge retrieval applications. However, existing RAG tutorials are often scattered and lack systematicity, making it difficult for beginners to form a complete understanding of the technical system.

Starting from practice and combining the latest RAG technology development trends, this project builds a complete RAG learning system to help developers:
- Systematically master the theoretical foundation and practical skills of RAG technology
- Understand the complete architecture of RAG systems and the role of each component
- Develop the ability to independently develop RAG applications
- Master evaluation and optimization methods for RAG systems

## Target Audience

**This project is suitable for the following groups:**
- Developers with Python programming foundation who are interested in RAG technology
- AI engineers who want to systematically learn RAG technology
- Product developers who want to build intelligent Q&A systems
- Researchers with learning needs for retrieval-augmented generation technology

**Prerequisites:**
- Master Python basic syntax and usage of common libraries
- Ability to use Docker simply
- Understanding of basic LLM concepts (recommended but not required)
- Basic Linux command line operation skills

## Project Highlights

1. **Systematic Learning Path**: From basic concepts to advanced applications, building a complete RAG technology learning system
2. **Theory and Practice Combined**: Each chapter includes theoretical explanation and code practice to ensure learning and application
3. **Multimodal Support**: Covers not only text RAG, but also multimodal embedding and retrieval technologies
4. **Engineering-Oriented**: Focus on engineering problems in practical applications, including performance optimization, system evaluation, etc.
5. **Rich Practical Projects**: Provides multiple practical projects from basic to advanced to help consolidate learning outcomes
